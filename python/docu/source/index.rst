Welcome to PyStella's documentation!
====================================


Overview
--------

PyStella is a collection of Python modules to read and process the many output
files generated by the radiation hydrodynamical code Stella.

Currently, the nomenclature in PyStella reflects the naming scheme of the
Stella source code or of the SM plotting scripts which served in some cases as
templates.
